# STM32 Embedded C - Absolute Beginners Projects

This repository contains my code, and hands-on practice from the **“Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: Absolute Beginners”** course by FastBit Embedded Systems. I worked through this course in the beginning of june and am currently working through another FastBit course, **"Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development"**. My main goal is to document my journey as I progress to becoming a full fledged Embedded Systems Engineer. 


The focus is on mastering the fundamentals of embedded C, STM32 microcontroller internals, and writing bare-metal programs using STM32CubeIDE — no HAL.
